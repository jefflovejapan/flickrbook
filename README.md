A work in progress, FlickrBook will ultimately let users search for Creative Commons licensed photos using Flickr's API and edit them using [Aviary's iOS SDK](http://developers.aviary.com/docs/ios). Because the SDK isn't licensed for free distribution, anyone wanting to use FlickrBook will have to download the SDK separately.

###Installing

1. Clone from source:

> git clone https://github.com/jefflovejapan/flickrbook.git

2. Make sure you have [CocoaPods installed](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

3. From inside the FlickrBook directory:

> pod install

4. Follow Aviary's instructions for adding the SDK to the project.

###Issues

Just getting started, nothing works.
